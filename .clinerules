# Technical Patterns and Rules

## Core Technology Rules
1. Use Next.js 15.2.2 for all routing and server-side rendering
2. Use React 19.0.0 with functional components and hooks
3. TypeScript is mandatory - no implicit any types allowed
4. Tailwind CSS for all styling - avoid custom CSS when possible

## Component Patterns
1. Use shadcn/ui components as base components
2. Custom components should extend shadcn/ui patterns
3. Use Radix primitives for accessible components
4. Follow atomic design principles for component structure

## State Management
1. Use React hooks for local state
2. Use React Hook Form for form management
3. Use Zod for form validation schemas

## Styling Rules
1. Use Tailwind utility classes as primary styling method
2. Use tailwind-merge for conditional class names
3. Use clsx for complex class name logic
4. Use tailwindcss-animate for animations

## Development Practices
1. Use Yarn as package manager
2. Follow ESLint and Prettier rules
3. Write tests using Playwright and Vitest
4. Use TypeScript types for all props and state

## Dependency Management
1. Keep dependencies updated to latest stable versions
2. Use specific version numbers in package.json
3. Document all major dependencies in techContext.md
4. Regularly audit dependencies for security updates
