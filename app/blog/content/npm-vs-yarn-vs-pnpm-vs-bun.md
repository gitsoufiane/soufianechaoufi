# npm vs Yarn vs pnpm vs Bun: Choosing the Right Package Manager

I remember the first time I ran `npm install` on a new project. I went to grab coffee, came back five minutes later, and it was still installing. Then I checked my disk space: I had the same React library installed 47 times across different projects. 47 times!

That's when I started exploring alternatives. Let me save you some time and break down what I've learned.

## What Even Is a Package Manager?

Think of it like the App Store on your phone, but for code. Need a date picker? A chart library? HTTP requests? Someone already built it. Package managers download these tools and keep them organized.

All four tools (npm, Yarn, pnpm, Bun) do this same basic job. The differences? Speed, disk space, and some bonus features.

## Meet The Contenders

### npm - The Default Choice

This is the OG. It comes with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), so if you've installed Node, you already have [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com). No extra setup needed.

**Why it's good:**
- Already on your machine (probably)
- Massive community - every tutorial uses npm
- Works everywhere without any fuss

**The downsides:**
- Slowest of the bunch (we're talking minutes vs seconds)
- Eats disk space like crazy (duplicates the same packages across projects)
- Sometimes different team members get different results (annoying!)

### Yarn - The Reliable Upgrade

Facebook built [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) when npm was having issues. There are two versions: Yarn Classic (v1) is rock-solid and what most people use. Yarn Berry (v2+) is a total rewrite with wild new features.

**Why I like it:**
- Way faster than npm
- Works offline! (Downloaded packages before? No internet needed)
- More secure (verifies packages weren't tampered with)
- Great for managing multiple related packages ([workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces))

**The gotchas:**
- Yarn Berry is powerful but weird (it's a whole thing)
- Some packages don't play nice with it
- You have to install it separately

**Real talk**: I used Yarn for years on production apps. It's solid and you can't go wrong with it.

### pnpm - The Space Saver

Here's the clever part: [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) doesn't copy packages to every project. It stores each package once on your computer and creates shortcuts (symlinks) to them. Got 50 projects using React? Only one copy on disk.

**Why it's awesome:**
- Lightning fast installs
- Saved me 50GB+ of disk space (seriously)
- Strict about dependencies (catches mistakes other tools miss)
- Perfect for big projects with multiple packages ([monorepos](https://monorepo.tools))

**The trade-offs:**
- Shortcuts can confuse some older tools
- Smaller community (but growing fast!)
- Strictness can break badly-written packages

**My take**: I switched to pnpm a year ago and never looked back. The disk savings alone are worth it.

### Bun - The Speed Demon

[Bun](https://bun.sh) is the new hotness. It's not just a package managerâ€”it runs your code, bundles it, and even has built-in testing. Built from scratch for pure speed.

**The hype is real:**
- FAST. Like, scary fast (10-20x faster than npm)
- Does everything - run code, install packages, bundle apps, run tests
- Works with existing npm packages (mostly)
- One tool instead of five

**But hold on:**
- Still new (released in 2023)
- Some npm packages don't work yet
- Smaller community means fewer Stack Overflow answers

**My opinion**: Bun is incredible for new projects and experimenting. For critical production stuff? I'd wait a bit longer for the ecosystem to mature.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | npm | Yarn | pnpm | Bun |
|---------|-----|------|------|-----|
| **Speed** | Slowest | Fast | Very Fast | Fastest |
| **Disk Space** | Most | Moderate | Least | Low |
| **Setup** | Built-in | Install separately | Install separately | Install separately |
| **Monorepo Support** | Basic | Excellent | Excellent | Good |
| **Offline Mode** | Limited | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Maturity** | Very Mature | Mature | Mature | New |

## Common Commands

Here's how to do the same tasks with each tool:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
yarn install
pnpm install
bun install

# Add a package
npm install react
yarn add react
pnpm add react
bun add react

# Remove a package
npm uninstall react
yarn remove react
pnpm remove react
bun remove react

# Update packages
npm update
yarn upgrade
pnpm update
bun update

# Run a script
npm run dev
yarn dev
pnpm dev
bun dev
```

## So Which One Should You Actually Use?

Let me give you the real answer, not the "it depends" cop-out:

**Use npm if:**
- You're just learning JavaScript (stick with what tutorials use)
- You want zero friction (it's already installed)
- You work on simple side projects
- Compatibility is your top priority

**Use Yarn if:**
- You're on a team that already uses it (don't fight the team)
- You manage a big project with multiple packages
- You need offline installs (sketchy wifi? I feel you)
- You want reliable speed without learning something new

**Use pnpm if:**
- You work on a laptop with limited disk space
- You have tons of projects on one machine
- You want the fastest possible installs
- You're building a monorepo (multiple related packages)

**Use Bun if:**
- You love trying new tech
- You're starting a greenfield project
- You want one tool for everything
- You're okay troubleshooting weird edge cases

## My Honest Recommendation

**If you're new to web dev**: Stick with npm. Learn the fundamentals first. Don't overwhelm yourself.

**If you're comfortable with JavaScript**: Switch to pnpm. You'll thank me when you save 50GB of disk space and installs finish in seconds instead of minutes.

**If you love shiny new things**: Try Bun! It's genuinely impressive. Just don't bet your startup on it quite yet.

**If you're on a team**: Use whatever they're using. Seriously, don't be that person who changes the package manager mid-project.

## How to Switch (It's Easier Than You Think)

Want to try a different package manager? Here's the complete guide:

1. **Delete the old stuff:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules           # Delete all installed packages
   rm package-lock.json          # npm's lock file
   rm yarn.lock                  # Yarn's lock file
   rm pnpm-lock.yaml             # pnpm's lock file
   rm bun.lockb                  # Bun's lock file
   ```

2. **Install with your new tool:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install  # or: yarn install, bun install, etc.
   ```

3. **Update your [CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/) pipelines** - Change GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc. to use the new package manager

4. **Commit the new lock file** - This is important! Your team needs it.

That's literally it. Your [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-package-json-file) doesn't change at all.

I've switched package managers on production apps multiple times. Never had a major issue. Just make sure to test everything after the switch.

## The Real Answer

Here's what nobody tells you: **there's no perfect choice**. Each tool has trade-offs.

npm is slow but reliable. Yarn is fast and proven. pnpm saves disk space. Bun is bleeding-edge.

My workflow? I use pnpm for everything now. It's fast, stable, and that disk space savings is chef's kiss. But npm is totally fine for most projects. And Bun? I'm watching it closely.

**The best advice**: Pick one, learn it well, and only switch when you have a real reason. Don't chase the shiny new tool every month.

Now go build something cool! ðŸš€
